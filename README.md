The Platform Proximity project focuses on real-time video processing to enhance platform safety. It uses advanced computer vision technologies, including OpenCV for video processing and YOLO for object detection, to monitor platform edges, measure distances, detect falls, and trigger emergency protocols.

Key features:
- Real-time video processing with object detection.
- Distance measurement using OpenCV.
- Fall detection with pose estimation models.
- Categorization of alerts based on proximity to the platform edge, ranging from verbal warnings to emergency alerts.

Challenges include blind spots in CCTV networks, changing regulations, video quality, and GPU processing requirements.

In a recent hackathon, the user's team secured a top 10 spot, earning recognition for their innovative project and strong teamwork. This experience showcased their problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure, marking a key milestone in their professional growth.
